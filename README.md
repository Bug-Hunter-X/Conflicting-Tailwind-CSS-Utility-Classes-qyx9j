# Conflicting Tailwind CSS Utility Classes
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: conflicting utility classes that prevent expected styles from being applied.

## Problem
The provided code snippet shows a div element with a red background that should change to blue on hover. However, due to a potential class conflict or improper order of classes, the hover effect may not work as expected.

## Solution
The solution involves reviewing the order and specificity of Tailwind utility classes to ensure the intended styles are applied correctly.  This might involve adjusting the order or using more specific classes to override conflicting styles.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the code in your preferred environment (e.g., a web browser).
3. Observe the behavior of the div element on hover. The hover effect might not work as intended due to the conflicting classes.
